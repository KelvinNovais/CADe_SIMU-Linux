    conditions:
    (1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this

    unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files
    must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
    (2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying
    documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of

    (3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts

    NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.

    These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,

    Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name

    This implementation is based on Arai, Agui, and Nakajima's algorithm for
    scaled DCT.  Their original paper (Trans. IEICE E-71(11):1095) is in
    Japanese, but the algorithm is described in the Pennebaker & Mitchell
    JPEG textbook (see REFERENCES section in file README).  The following code
    is based directly on figure 4-8 in P&M.
