----------------------------------------------------
-- Configuration -----------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------

libcapi20 features autodetection of connected CAPI
devices. In case you need to select a special device
use the remote configuration file:
  ~/.capi20rc
if it doesn't exist look for
  /etc/capi20.conf

To set the remote machine, the above file need to have
the following line
  REMOTE <driver> <remote hostname|ip-address> <remote port>

Drivers:
	* fritzbox	- Remote CAPI via FRITZ!Box
	* rcapi		- Melware Remote CAPI

If this doesn't exist, the library tries the old, normal way
of using the local /dev/isdn/capi20.
